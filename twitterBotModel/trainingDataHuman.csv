Thank you for the best 25 years we could ask for.  Warped Tour is the fans that came through our gates, it is the bands that played our stages, and it is the crew that carried us city to city. 

so long and goodnight, we'll miss you.⁠

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/IJ1LY57FHk EP 24: Warped Off Days
Most summers, the Warped Tour routing was insane, but the record goes to 2004 when we did 58 shows in 50 days.  So of course we pushed the bands and crew to make those few off days as epic as possible!
🎥 episodes: https://t.co/WgJkcHhMAm

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/LMVmwRVAhM EP 23: The Nightly BBQ
After the show ended, the bands and crew would gather around the BBQ.  It brought everyone together and kept the camaraderie strong.  Special shout out to every BBQ band who busted their ass grilling just to get a chance to play.

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/W2vjb3WFIg EP 22: Bro Hymn
In 1996, Jason of @Pennywise passed away before the Warped Tour.  Instead of cancelling, the band decided to play ""Bro Hymn"" every day to honor their friend.  So we knew that Pennywise had to be the final set the final cross-country tour.

#warpedtour https://t.co/dsrxmYcgL3 EP 21: Fan Friendly
From the beginning Warped Tour was designed for the fans.  We worked hard to keep a low ticket price, to bring new music to smaller cities, and to encourage bands to meet their fans every day.
🎥 https://t.co/WgJkcHhMAm

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/yTC1idl7qx EP 20: The Food Fight
Well, you see sometimes it's hard to leave the shenanigans in the parking lot, and sometimes Ice T, punk rockers, and motocross riders launch an epic food fight.
🤫That's all we can say - we plead the fifth!

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/XV3xxDVE4v EP 19: Express Yourself
The looks may have evolved over the years from spiked mohawks and denim jackets, to the emo fringe and skinny jeans, to pompadour and checkerboard vans, but the ethos of creativity and self-expression remained.
🎥 https://t.co/WgJkcHhMAm

#vanswarpedtour https://t.co/fB83noIndw EP 18: Parents + Kids
Over the years, it was amazing to see parents rough the heat to give their kid a great experience.  In the end, we even saw fans from the first few years of Warped Tour come back 15+ years later with their kids!

52661430,"In fact, this operation fits the 4D model I developed back in 2015 to analyse influence ops: 

Dismiss by denigrating the protesters; 
Distort the conversation with fake accounts; 
Distract, by accusing the opposition of your own behaviour; 
Dismay government critics. Later, they pivoted to more pro-government content, including from their bigger media brands. But they also accused independent outlets of being “the chorus of fake news”. 

Trolls love turning reality inside out. https://t.co/UfrcOdbgOt The operation on our platform kicked off in April 2018, after anti-government protests broke out. 

The operation first tried to discredit the protesters and mass report them in an unsuccessful attempt to have them taken down. The operators did this as their day job. They posted Monday to Friday, 9 to 5, with an hour for lunch and a skeleton crew at the weekend. 

Flooding the online conversation in Nicaragua with pro-government and anti-opposition messaging appeared to be the goal. https://t.co/aVAIqx8soC This troll farm was mainly run from the Post Office headquarters in Managua by employees of TELCOR, the Institute of Telecommunications and Postal Services. Smaller clusters ran from other government institutions as well. Two things to note on this operation:

1) This was the closest thing to a “whole-of-government” operation we’ve seen.

2) The troll farm lived across the internet: own media websites built on wordpress, blogspot, amplified on FB, IG, TikTok, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, etc. Important terminology point: over the years, I’ve seen some confusion over what constitutes a “troll farm”, as opposed to clickbait/content farms. 

Here’s how we understand it. https://t.co/nGUppHSUE8 🚨 JUST OUT: We took down a troll farm in Nicaragua, run by the Nicaraguan government and the FSLN party. 
Our team’s research here: 
https://t.co/ipV7pdvse2 Final point: there’s been awesome research into this operation by the open-source community, and we owe the initial exposure to @dirtybiology and @mrwissen2go. 

Hats off to all of them for breaking the ground on this one. That highlights the dilemma for influence operations. Do you go for low-impact tactics and stay hidden, or do you go for the big bang of influencers with built-in audiences, and risk having your operation exposed?

https://t.co/QmXPA21n6q We know from open-source reporting that the operation tried to recruit influencers. But we also know that it backfired: two of the influencers went public.

#ThisCantWait Public funding of $4 billion has gone to speculative ""carbon capture"" projects already &amp; there’s nothing to show for it. 

☀️ Meanwhile, solar and wind energy is breaking all the records and plummeting in cost. Our @CEFCAus returns a profit to the public. Every coal, oil &amp; gas corporation wants a ""get out of jail free"" card.

That's why the Morrison Government plans to waste more public funds on the ""carbon capture &amp; storage"" pipe dream. 🤯 @ScottMorrisonMP is trying AGAIN to divert funds from our clean energy bank @CEFCAus to polluting gas corporations. 

The only carbon capture going on is the capture of politics by polluters.

Eso sí: piden reformas del mercado de trabajo.

The 32-year-old is believed to have launched a second application after the first failed, and was staying in asylum accommodation run by government contractor Serco The Law Society said half of asylum appeals were upheld and it was not lawyers, but “poor Home Office decision-making coupled with catastrophic delays that are crippling the asylum system”

Several lawyers raised safety concerns and pointed to this case

https://t.co/683kKoEeE0 Critics accused Patel of ""deflecting"" amid questions over why the Home Office had failed to deport the Liverpool bomber after an asylum application failed, and how security services failed to spot at least 7 months of preparations for the attack The home secretary told journalists that the attack was a reflection of ""broken"" asylum system and took aim at a “whole professional legal services industry ... that thinks it's right to defend these individuals that cause the most appalling crimes against British citizens"" Priti Patel has been accused of stoking anger against lawyers with “grotesque” comments over the Liverpool Women’s Hospital bombing

Lawyers say it's ""poor Home Office decision-making"" and delays that are to blame for a dysfunctional asylum system 

https://t.co/PVfxl3VhvD The length of planning and preparation for the attack will spark fresh questions over why the plot was not detected by security services

The Independent understands al-Swealmeen was not previously known to MI5 or counter-terror police The terrorist who blew himself up outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital had been planning an attack since at least April, police have said

Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, rented the flat where he built the bomb in that month and had been making ""relevant purchases""

Kevin McCar… Did delaying this remarkable infrastructure bill hurt Biden and the Democrats? 

On Aug 11th, the day after the bill passed the Senate, Biden was 50.3-43.3, +7, on @FiveThirtyEight.  

Today he is 42.8-51.7, -8.9.  It's a 16 point swing. So how many other Republicans can’t be trusted with the people’s money?

But as I sit w/the data we have, I keep coming back to the same conclusion - if Biden can defeat COVID by spring, and normal life feels like it's returning, the 2022 elections will be competitive.  7/

https://t.co/aLDm5oIfwk Which suggests that the way we should be talking about inflation is through the lens of defeating COVID.  

Our voters believe this is far more about COVID than spending, and aren't freaking out about it as Rs are.  

We should not overreact here.  6/
https://t.co/J2WFIrteVo So for Dem 2022 targets, inflation is as of now clearly a second tier issue, and 70% blame the pandemic not Biden. 

For R voters, it ranks third as an issue of concern, at 45%, and 73% blame Biden/spending.  

This is just a totally different information universe. 5/ Using the Navigator question of what are the 4 most important issues for Biden/Congress to be addressing, we see a similar r/w noise machine effect.

#DeadandCompany #HollywoodBowl #GratefulDead #DeadHead #DeadHeadLife 🙏 Judge Windham shares he has been vaccinated.

""Both legal teams, start to finish on other side, have been vaccinated."" - Lewin

Lewin acknowledges they can't ask the jurors if they have been vaccinated but Judge Windham says we should encourage them to be.

#RobertDurst #Trial Judge Windham denies #RobertDurst's defense motion to delay the trial. Mr. DeGuerin shares that #RobertDurst has severe health issues and spends 90% of his time on his back in bed. 

""This is something that is very serious. The doctor says it is not whether he can endure the rigor of the trial, it is if he can survive at all."" - Mr. DeGuerin Judge Windham, ""We have jurors coming in about 10 minutes. I am going to welcome those jurors, I am going to speak with those jurors.""

#RobertDurst #RobertDurst is not present in court this morning. The judge informs the court room that Mr. Durst has allegedly declined his transportation to the courtroom and is voluntarily absent.
